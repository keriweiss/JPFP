Keri, this is absolutely stunning! Between the both of us, this is the best JPFP I've seen. (but shhh!)
I love that you started using functional components. The homepage looks absolutely beautiful.
I really really like the pagination component.
Your react components are really well done. Typically, JPFPs aren't in a good enough shape to be a portfolio piece, but this looks great! I made a couple of comments in your redux files about getting the data, but otherwise, this looks really good!
